# Car Rental Management System(Rentit)

## Overview
The Car Rental Management System is a software application that allows admins to manage cars available for rent, handle bookings, generate reports, and ensure secure access through a login module. The system is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including inheritance, composition, polymorphism, and exception handling.

## Features

### 1. Login Module
- Ensures access control by allowing only authorized users to log in.
- Users table includes two admin users who are the only valid system users.

### 2. Car Module
- **Add Car Details**: Allows admins to add new cars to the system.
- **Delete Car Details**: Remove cars that are no longer available for rental.
- **Update Car Details**: Modify existing car details.
- **View All Car Details**: List all registered cars in the system.

### 3. Search Module
- **List of Available Cars for Rent**: Display cars currently available for rental.
- **Search by Economic Price**: Retrieve cars available within a specific price range.
- **Check Availability by Capacity**: Search for cars based on passenger capacity.
- **Search by Fuel Type**: Filter available cars based on fuel type.

### 4. Booking Module
- **List Available Cars for Booking**: Displays all cars that can be booked.
- **Car Booking**: Allows users to book a car.
- **Generate Bill**: Computes the total rental cost based on various factors.
- **Add Booking Details to Database**: Stores booking information in the system.

### 5. Report Generation Module
- **Report by Vehicle Type**: Generate reports categorized by car type.
- **Booking Report (Date Range)**: Generate a report of bookings within a given date range.
- **Sales Report**: Calculate total revenue generated by the system.
- **Customer Report**: Generate a report listing customer details and their bookings.

## System Design

### Classes
1. **Customer**
   - Stores customer-related information.
   - Contains appropriate data members with getter and setter methods.

2. **Car**
   - Stores car-related information such as model, price, fuel type, and capacity.
   - Contains necessary attributes and getter-setter methods.

3. **Booking**
   - Manages booking information including customer details, car details, and rental period.

### Services
1. **CarService**
   - `addCar()`: Adds a new car to the system.
   - `updateCar()`: Updates car details.
   - `deleteCar()`: Deletes a car from the system.
   - `loadCarDetails()`: Retrieves all car details from the database.
   - Handles exceptions in case of database errors.
   - Validates input data before processing.

2. **BookingService**
   - `checkAvailability()`: Checks if a car is available for booking.
   - `bookCar()`: Allows users to book a car.
   - `calculateBill()`: Computes the total rental cost based on fuel type, capacity, and price per kilometer.

## Key Concepts Used
- **Inheritance** (‘is-a’ relationship)
- **Composition** (‘has-a’ relationship)
- **Polymorphism**
- **Abstract Classes & Interfaces**
- **Exception Handling**
- **Input Validation**

## Requirements
- Programming Language: Java/Python (or any preferred language)
- Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL
- Frameworks: Spring Boot (for Java) / Flask (for Python) (optional)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (if applicable)
- Tools: Eclipse/IntelliJ/PyCharm

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the database and configure connection settings.
3. Run the application.
4. Log in as an admin to start managing cars and bookings.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement user roles with different permission levels.
- Integrate payment gateway for online payments.
- Add customer feedback and rating system.
- Mobile-friendly UI for easier access.
